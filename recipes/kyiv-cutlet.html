    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Kyiv-style cutlet (or Chicken Kyiv) is a classic, if dated, dish consisting of pounded chicken cutlets 
        wrapped around cold compound butter packed with garlic and herbs, breaded, and 
        deep fried—essentially a chicken cutlet that sauces itself once you cut it open. 
        It`s a little bit of old-timey culinary sleight of hand, a way to elevate a 
        breaded cutlet into a performance on a plate.</p>

        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol class="steps">
        <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
        <li>Grind garlic and pinch of salt together in a mortar and pestle until smooth; add parsley and mix well. Pound butter into garlic mixture with the pestle until well combined. Wrap butter mixture in plastic wrap; refrigerate until cold, at least 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Season chicken breasts with salt and pepper. Place 1/4 of the butter mixture in the center of the wider end of each chicken breast.</li>
        <li>Fold the narrower end of each chicken breast up over butter to form a tight pocket around the butter; gather the sides of each chicken breast to the center to form a round ball. The top of each chicken ball will be smooth and the bottom will be gathered. Tightly wrap each chicken ball in plastic wrap; transfer to a plate and chill in the freezer until the gathered bottoms hold together and are slightly firm, about 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Whisk flour and 2 teaspoons salt together in a shallow bowl. Whisk eggs together in another shallow bowl. Pour panko bread crumbs into a third bowl.</li>
        <li>Remove chicken breast balls from plastic wrap. Gently press them into flour mixture to coat; shake off any excess flour. Dip into beaten eggs, then press into bread crumbs. Place breaded chicken on a plate; cover with plastic wrap, and return to the freezer to chill until firm, about 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil. Working in batches, place chicken, gathered-side down, in hot oil and cook until lightly golden, about 1 minute per side. Transfer chicken to the prepared baking sheet; sprinkle salt and cayenne pepper over the top.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until you can hear the butter start to sizzle on the baking sheet, 15 to 17 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Let rest for a few minutes before serving.</li>
